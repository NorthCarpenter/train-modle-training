This project is based on data scraped from https://juckins.net/asmad/index.php. Christopher Juckins has done an exelent job keeping track of AMTRACK data since 2001.

The goal of this project is to modle where and when AMTRAK trains arive late. The longshot goal of this project is to creat a probability distribution of when AMTRAK trains will arive at a given station at a given date and time.
